# EV-vehicles-Data-Analysis-using-tableau
This project offers an in-depth analysis of electric vehicles (EVs), focusing on key metrics such as vehicle counts, range, model distribution, and regional insights. The analysis was conducted using Tableau and visualized in a comprehensive, interactive dashboard.

# Problem Statement
The goal of this analysis is to understand the current landscape and adoption patterns of electric vehicles (both BEVs and PHEVs) across different regions, manufacturers, and models. The dashboard is designed to support decision-making, market research, and technological insights.

# KPI's Requirements
## Total Vehicles
  Understand the overall landscape of electric vehicles (EVs), encompassing both Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), to assess the market's size and growth.
    
## Average Electric Range
Determine the average electric range of EVs in the dataset to assess technological advancements and vehicle efficiency.

## Total BEV Vehicles and % of Total BEV Vehicles
1. Identify the total number of BEVs.
2. Calculate the share of BEVs out of all EVs to evaluate the rise of fully electric models.

## Total PHEV Vehicles and % of Total PHEV Vehicles
1. Identify the total number of PHEVs.
2. Assess the share of PHEVs to understand hybrid market penetration.
